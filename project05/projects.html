        <p>For this project, we were assigned a dataset from an energy company in South Carolina, tasked with better understanding how energy consumption and energy prices shift throughout the year. Specifically, we were tasked with focusing on the month of July and were given information about the houses (such as appliances, pools, air conditioning, etc.) and how their Kwh (Kilowatts per hour) changed throughout the month. In addition, we were provided with data on the temperature outside for comparison. I found that on hot days, energy consumption stretched the capabilities of the energy company, suggesting they may need to update their infrastructure or change pricing strategies. I also simulated a scenario by adding 5 degrees to each day, and based on an SVM model, over 90% of the days would overextend energy resources. My recommendations included updating infrastructure, raising prices on peak days, or finding alternative energy sources. This was my first real data science project using R and machine learning techniques.</p>

        <p>In this project, I created a Python pipeline that pulls in data via an API related to sports betting odds. I used the JSON output to clean and process the data and then built a Streamlit application that allows users to choose a sporting event and compare betting odds from major bookmakers like FanDuel and DraftKings. This project helped me understand APIs, JSON structure, data cleaning in Python, and user interaction with Streamlit interfaces.</p>

        <p>For this project, I used a dataset scraped from LinkedIn job postings with over 30,000 records. The data included job location, remote status, and salary. I cleaned the data, built a story using visuals created in R, and presented my findings on a professional poster during Poster Day. My visualizations showed that remote jobs tended to offer higher salaries and pointed out geographic trends in job availability. This helped build my skills in R, data visualization, and professional communication.</p>
