        <h1>Connor Cluett's Biography</h1>
        <p>
        I am a Junior Applied Data Analytics Major in School of Information Studies and am fascinated with emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and how data is at the forefront of these innovations. 
        </p>

        <p>
        I have taken classes on <strong>SQL, Python, R, Machine Learning, and Big Data</strong> in my semesters here at Syracuse University. I am proud of how hard I have worked for my grades and am now part of an Undergraduate Research Group run through the SOURCE. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Outside of my schoolwork, I enjoy watching sports and cheering on my favorite teams. I love all Boston Sports, Syracuse, and am a Gonzaga College Basketball fan with aspirations for a 2025 March Madness title. I have an older sister who is a senior at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) in Massachusetts and my younger sister is a sophomore in high school. My dad works for a company that makes large touchscreen monitors for stadiums and media sets, while my mom works in admissions at WPI. I am not a big fan of television shows as I would rather play video games in my free time with my friends from back home. I am excited for this upcoming semester and hope to continually grow my knowledge within technology!!
